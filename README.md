# About the Project
⭐️ Philly Codefest 2023 Hackathon: Comcast Customer Journey Optimization Winner

Built by Amin & Amadin Ahmed

We created an AI Model to predict whether a customer will churn or not based on a telecom company’s demographic data.

# Requirements
Comcast - Build an AI-ML model for customer journey optimization.
Description: This code challenge is to build an AI/ML model that can optimize a customer's journey. The model must be able to use data from customer behaviors and preferences to predict their next steps and optimize their overall customer journey. The challenge is to create a model that can accurately capture customer data and effectively suggest the best actions for them to take to increase customer satisfaction and engagement. The model should be able to adapt to changing customer needs and behaviors over time and should be able to optimize customer experiences across multiple customer touchpoints. The challenge also requires coding and analytics skills to create, deploy and monitor the model and its performance.
Participants can choose any customer journey related to sales and support such as order portal or reaching out to customer care through different medium/channels.

Judging criteria:

1. Algorithmic Structure: Judges should evaluate the complexity of the algorithms and how accurately they tackle the task at hand.
2. Model Performance: Judges should evaluate the accuracy of the model, the learning rate, and the amount of data needed for the model to be successful.
3. Scalability: Judges should evaluate how quickly the model can scale to handle larger datasets and more diverse real-world data.
4. Innovation: Judges should evaluate the creativity used to develop the model and the unique elements introduced.

Winning team members will receive a Comcast prize package including an invitation for a tour of the Comcast Innovation Center along with a lunch meeting with Comcast executives.
