# About the Project
⭐️ Philly Codefest 2023 Hackathon: Comcast Customer Journey Optimization Winner

https://devpost.com/software/retained-prediction-model-optimized-for-customer-churn

Built by Amin & Amadin Ahmed

We created an AI Model to predict whether a customer will churn or not based on a telecom company’s demographic data.

# Requirements
Comcast - Build an AI-ML model for customer journey optimization.
Description: This code challenge is to build an AI/ML model that can optimize a customer's journey. The model must be able to use data from customer behaviors and preferences to predict their next steps and optimize their overall customer journey. The challenge is to create a model that can accurately capture customer data and effectively suggest the best actions for them to take to increase customer satisfaction and engagement. The model should be able to adapt to changing customer needs and behaviors over time and should be able to optimize customer experiences across multiple customer touchpoints. The challenge also requires coding and analytics skills to create, deploy and monitor the model and its performance.
Participants can choose any customer journey related to sales and support such as order portal or reaching out to customer care through different medium/channels.

Judging criteria:

1. Algorithmic Structure: Judges should evaluate the complexity of the algorithms and how accurately they tackle the task at hand.
2. Model Performance: Judges should evaluate the accuracy of the model, the learning rate, and the amount of data needed for the model to be successful.
3. Scalability: Judges should evaluate how quickly the model can scale to handle larger datasets and more diverse real-world data.
4. Innovation: Judges should evaluate the creativity used to develop the model and the unique elements introduced.

Winning team members will receive a Comcast prize package including an invitation for a tour of the Comcast Innovation Center along with a lunch meeting with Comcast executives.


# Inspiration
All of the efforts that you put into obtaining a customer in the customer journey is useless if they don't stay on the platform. If we can find a way to predict if a customer is likely to leave your platform, the business can take preventative actions to assist the customer. Ex: talking to the customer to gain qualitative insights or even give them a promotional offer / incentive.

We give the business a signal to act on, before the customer potentially leaves.

# What does it do
Given Customer data our model can predict whether a customer is likely to churn or not.

# How we built it
We built the model using sklearn, xgboost and one hot encoding. We then packaged everything using a python front-end framework called stream-lit.

# Challenges we ran into
We ran into an issue when calling the prediction model on our front-end framework. There was an issue connecting the front-end and the back-end together. We were stuck on it for a couple hours.

# Accomplishments that we're proud of
Getting the model to run on the browser for the first time correctly was a very happy moment for us. We high-fived and said, "Let's go".
